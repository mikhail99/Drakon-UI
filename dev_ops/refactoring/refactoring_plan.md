# Drakon UI Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a prioritized plan for refactoring the Drakon UI codebase, based on the analyses of component architecture, state management, and code quality. The plan is structured into phases with tasks prioritized by:

1. **Impact on Maintainability**: How much the change will improve code clarity, reduce complexity, and facilitate future development
2. **Effort Required**: The estimated time and complexity to implement the change
3. **Risk of Regression**: The potential for introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality

Each task is assigned a priority score (High/Medium/Low) for each of these dimensions, and an overall priority based on the combination of these factors.

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements (2 weeks)

These tasks provide the highest value-to-effort ratio and establish a stronger foundation for subsequent refactoring work.

### 1.1 Split Graph Store into Domain-Specific Stores

**Description**: Refactor the monolithic Zustand store into smaller, focused stores for graph elements, UI state, and history management.

**Approach**:

- Define consistent prop interfaces for all node types
- Refactor existing node components to use the base component

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **High** - Reduces duplication and standardizes component patterns
- Effort Required: **Low** - Clear patterns already exist in current components
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Can be implemented incrementally with visual validation

**Overall Priority**: **High**

### 1.3 Implement Error Boundaries and Standardized Error Handling

**Description**: Add error boundaries around key components and standardize error handling patterns.

**Approach**:
- Create GraphErrorBoundary component
- Implement utility for standardized error handling

- Add tests for each hook

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Reduces duplication and clarifies component code
- Effort Required: **Medium** - Requires identifying patterns and designing abstractions
- Risk of Regression: **Medium** - Changes interaction patterns but with isolated scope

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

### 2.3 Standardize Component File Structure

**Description**: Establish and enforce consistent file structure and organization for components.

**Approach**:
- Define template for component file organization
- Refactor existing components to follow the template
- Update documentation for future development

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Improves code navigation and consistency
- Effort Required: **Medium** - Involves many files but with mechanical changes
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Structural changes with minimal functional impact

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

## Phase 3: State Management Optimization (2 weeks)

These tasks focus on improving state management efficiency and patterns.

### 3.1 Implement Selective History Management

**Description**: Optimize the undo/redo system to track only changed state parts rather than full snapshots.

**Approach**:
- Design more efficient history tracking mechanism
- Implement incremental state updates
- Add performance tests comparing before/after

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Improves performance for large graphs
- Effort Required: **High** - Complex state tracking logic
- Risk of Regression: **High** - Critical feature with subtle edge cases

**Overall Priority**: **Medium** (high value but significant risk)

### 3.2 Add Memoization for Performance-Critical Components

**Description**: Identify and optimize components with unnecessary re-renders using memoization.

**Approach**:
- Profile application to identify render bottlenecks
- Add React.memo with appropriate comparison functions
- Implement useMemo for expensive calculations

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Improves performance and clarifies dependencies
- Effort Required: **Low** - Incremental changes to existing components
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Changes are additive and easily tested

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

### 3.3 Standardize Store Access Patterns

**Description**: Create consistent patterns for accessing store state across components.

**Approach**:
- Replace direct getState() calls with hooks
- Implement selector functions for common data access
- Update component documentation for store access

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Clarifies component-store relationships
- Effort Required: **Medium** - Requires changes across multiple components

2. **Visual Regression Tests**: Implement visual testing for UI components
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baselines and compare before/after

### Phased Rollout

1. **Foundation First**: Complete Phase 1 to establish better patterns
2. **Incremental Changes**: Implement changes in small, testable increments
3. **Regular Integration**: Merge changes frequently to catch integration issues early

### Success Metrics

1. **Code Quality Metrics**:
   - Reduced component complexity (measured by cyclomatic complexity)
   - Improved type coverage (fewer any types)
   - Reduced duplication (measured by static analysis)

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Render times for large graphs
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Interaction responsiveness

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Time to implement new features
   - Bug rate in refactored vs. non-refactored areas

## Timeline and Resource Allocation

### Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Weeks 1-2
- **Phase 2**: Weeks 3-5
- **Phase 3**: Weeks 6-7
- **Phase 4**: Weeks 8-10

### Resource Allocation

- Dedicate at least 20% of development time to refactoring
- Pair programming for high-risk refactoring tasks
- Regular code reviews with focus on adherence to new patterns

## Conclusion

This refactoring plan prioritizes improvements that provide the greatest benefit for maintainability while balancing effort and risk. By focusing first on structural improvements and patterns, we lay the groundwork for more specific optimizations later. The phased approach ensures that the application remains stable throughout the process while steadily improving in quality and maintainability.
