# Drakon UI Refactoring Plan
There are still some type issues in the Sidebar component related to the PortType enum which would need additional work, but we've made significant progress in the migration from nodeType to type.

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements 


### 1.1 Split Graph Store into Domain-Specific Stores

**Description**: Refactor the monolithic Zustand store into smaller, focused stores for graph elements, UI state, and history management.

**Approach**:
- Create separate stores for graph elements, UI state, and history
- Implement cross-store communication using hooks
- Update component references progressively

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **High** - Reduces complexity and improves state organization
- Effort Required: **Medium** - Requires careful separation but follows clear boundaries
- Risk of Regression: **Medium** - Affects core state management but with testable boundaries

**Overall Priority**: **High**

### 1.2 Create BaseNode Component and Standardize Node Interfaces

**Description**: Implement a BaseNode component that all node types extend, with standardized prop interfaces.

**Approach**:
- Extract common node rendering logic into BaseNode
- Define consistent prop interfaces for all node types
- Refactor existing node components to use the base component

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **High** - Reduces duplication and standardizes component patterns
- Effort Required: **Low** - Clear patterns already exist in current components
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Can be implemented incrementally with visual validation

**Overall Priority**: **High**

### 1.3 Implement Error Boundaries and Standardized Error Handling

**Description**: Add error boundaries around key components and standardize error handling patterns.

**Approach**:
- Create GraphErrorBoundary component
- Implement utility for standardized error handling
- Add boundaries to highest-risk components first

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Improves error visibility and debugging
- Effort Required: **Low** - Straightforward implementation with React patterns
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Additive change with minimal disruption

**Overall Priority**: **High**

## Phase 2: Component Refinement 


### 2.1 Refactor GraphEditor Component

**Description**: Split the large GraphEditor component into smaller, focused components with clear responsibilities.

**Approach**:
- Extract GraphToolbar, GraphCanvas, and SidePanel into separate components
- Create custom hooks for specific functionality (selection, viewport, etc.)
- Reduce prop drilling through context or dedicated hooks

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **High** - Addresses the most complex component in the codebase
- Effort Required: **High** - Significant restructuring of core component
- Risk of Regression: **High** - Central to application functionality

**Overall Priority**: **High** (requires careful planning and testing)










### 2.2 Extract Common UI Patterns into Reusable Hooks

**Description**: Create custom hooks for frequently used patterns like drag-and-drop, context menus, and selections.

**Approach**:
- Implement useContextMenu, useDragAndDrop, and useSelection hooks
- Refactor components to use these hooks
- Add tests for each hook

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Reduces duplication and clarifies component code
- Effort Required: **Medium** - Requires identifying patterns and designing abstractions
- Risk of Regression: **Medium** - Changes interaction patterns but with isolated scope

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

### 2.3 Standardize Component File Structure

**Description**: Establish and enforce consistent file structure and organization for components.

**Approach**:
- Define template for component file organization
- Refactor existing components to follow the template
- Update documentation for future development

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Improves code navigation and consistency
- Effort Required: **Medium** - Involves many files but with mechanical changes
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Structural changes with minimal functional impact

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

## Phase 3: State Management Optimization 

These tasks focus on improving state management efficiency and patterns.

### 3.1 Implement Selective History Management

**Description**: Optimize the undo/redo system to track only changed state parts rather than full snapshots.

**Approach**:
- Design more efficient history tracking mechanism
- Implement incremental state updates
- Add performance tests comparing before/after

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Improves performance for large graphs
- Effort Required: **High** - Complex state tracking logic
- Risk of Regression: **High** - Critical feature with subtle edge cases

**Overall Priority**: **Medium** (high value but significant risk)

### 3.2 Add Memoization for Performance-Critical Components

**Description**: Identify and optimize components with unnecessary re-renders using memoization.

**Approach**:
- Profile application to identify render bottlenecks
- Add React.memo with appropriate comparison functions
- Implement useMemo for expensive calculations

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Improves performance and clarifies dependencies
- Effort Required: **Low** - Incremental changes to existing components
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Changes are additive and easily tested

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

### 3.3 Standardize Store Access Patterns

**Description**: Create consistent patterns for accessing store state across components.

**Approach**:
- Replace direct getState() calls with hooks
- Implement selector functions for common data access
- Update component documentation for store access

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Clarifies component-store relationships
- Effort Required: **Medium** - Requires changes across multiple components
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Pattern changes with limited functional impact

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

## Phase 4: Type Safety and Code Quality (3 weeks)

These tasks focus on improving type definitions and overall code quality.

### 4.1 Implement Type Hierarchies for Node Data

**Description**: Create proper type hierarchies for node data, replacing generic types with specific ones.

**Approach**:
- Design type hierarchy starting with BaseNodeData
- Create specific types for each node category
- Replace any with specific types throughout the codebase

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **High** - Significantly improves type safety and IDE support
- Effort Required: **High** - Requires careful design and widespread changes
- Risk of Regression: **Medium** - Type changes may expose existing issues

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

### 4.2 Simplify Complex Conditional Logic

**Description**: Refactor complex conditional rendering and logic into clearer patterns.

**Approach**:
- Extract conditional rendering into named functions
- Convert nested conditionals to early returns
- Implement lookup maps for complex switch logic

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Medium** - Improves code readability
- Effort Required: **Medium** - Incremental improvements across codebase
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Limited scope changes with clear before/after

**Overall Priority**: **Medium**

### 4.3 Remove Dead Code and Improve Documentation

**Description**: Clean up unused code, commented-out sections, and improve documentation.

**Approach**:
- Configure ESLint to detect unused code
- Systematically remove commented-out code
- Add/improve JSDoc comments for public APIs

**Priority Analysis**:
- Impact on Maintainability: **Low** - Incremental improvements to clarity
- Effort Required: **Low** - Mechanical changes
- Risk of Regression: **Low** - Minimal functional impact

**Overall Priority**: **Low** (important but lower urgency)

## Implementation Strategy

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests First**: Add or update unit tests before refactoring components
2. **Visual Regression Tests**: Implement visual testing for UI components
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baselines and compare before/after
